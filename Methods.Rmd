# Methods
## Study Design 

<!--This study followed of a pilot experiment, performed by Asvini Kulanayagam, a former student of Sleep & Neuroplasticity lab at Queen's University for her Honours Thesis. Although the majority of data used in the current study have been collected across two-years of my Master's studies, I have benefited from some of the results of the pilot experiment. All of the raw data of this study can be accessed at [GitHub repository of this study](https://github.com/mohdasti/Queens-Thesis/tree/master/Raw%20data).--> <!-- THIS PART SHOULD BE MOVED TO RESULTS -->
\par
The current study was comprised of two parts, typically carried out over two separate days: *Initial Interview* and the *Experiment*. This design was chosen to allow participants to familiarize themselves with the study and testing environment (particularly the room for napping and meditation) prior to the main experiment and data collection. \par

*Interview*: During the initial interview, the researcher provided a brief summary of the study and associated methodology, and showed the facility to prospective participants. Subsequently, participants were asked to sign the Letter of Information and Consent, the Participant Information Survey, and to complete the "Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory" (FMI) [@walach2006measuring] (See Appendix C, D, E). Based on the participant’s responses and history of activities, the researcher assigned him/her to one of the three experimental conditions (random assignment for napping/wake conditions). \par

*Experiment*: Typically, all experimental procedures were conducted between 10 a.m. and 7 p.m. Participants arrived at the Sleep Laboratory and completed the “Epworth Sleepiness Scale” (ESS)[@johns1991new]. Importantly, the instructions for completion of the ESS were modified to ask participants to indicate the *current* level of sleepiness, rather than the overall level of sleepiness experienced over the recent past.
Nest, participants completed the learning phase of the paired associates (word-pair) task used to assess declarative memory (see below for details), followed by training in the marble maze task (see below) used to assess non-declarative memory. Subsequently, participants were prepared for the electroencephalography (EEG), electro-oculography (EOG), and electromyography (EMG) recordings and informed of their assigned condition (meditation, nap, wake). \par

Following the completion of the electrode set-up and calibration procedure, participants spent 60 minutes in a quiet room. For the wake condition, participants watched the documentary movie “Planet Earth” [@Fothergill2007] on a computer screen. Participants in the meditation condition were asked to complete a self-guided meditation session, and for the nap condition, they were instructed to sleep in the bed. During this period, brain activity, eye movements, and muscle activity were monitored with polysomnography. \par
After the hour-long treatment, the researcher informed the participant that the hour was completed. After removing the electrodes, depending on their treatment condition, participants completed a self-report on the quality of their activity (nap, meditation, wake) in the room, as well as a post-treatment \textsc{ess} questionnaire (See Appendix F, G, H, I). Subsequently, they were asked to complete 50 trials of the maze task and the word-pair recall test (post-treatment tasks were completed in a counterbalanced order). At the end, participants were debriefed (see Appendix J) and given monetary compensation, if applicable. The overall timeline of the study design is illustrated in Table 1.

## Participants
  Participants were recruited from the Queen’s University Psychology subject pool, advertised posts on the Queen’s University paid research studies Facebook group, posters displayed on campus and yoga studios of downtown Kingston, or word-of-mouth (see Appendix A). To be eligible for the study, participants were required to be between the ages of 18 and 65, with no previous diagnosis of psychiatric, neurological, or sleep disorders, and to not take sleep medications. Some specific inclusion criteria included the following: participants must nap for an average of three times a week over the last three weeks to be included in the nap condition; participants must practice meditation for an average of at least three times a week to be included in the meditation group. All participants received monetary compensation for the completion of the 3 hours study, with the exception of participants from Psychology 100 and 200 subject pools, who received a course credit plus monetary compensation for their participation. The study was approved by the Queen’s University General Research Ethics Board (See Appendix B). After the initial interview and verification of inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of `r nrow(RAW_data) +5` participants completed the study (mean age = `r round(mean(RAW_data$Age, digits=2))` $\pm$ `r trunc(sd(RAW_data$Age))` years old, `r length(which(RAW_data$Gender == "F"))` female). However, 9 individuals were unable to comply with the experimental conditions (e.g., participants who dozed off during the meditation session or while watching the movie), leaving us with `r nrow(RAW_data) -4` of participants. In addition, a 2 standard deviation cut-off was applied to all behavioural tests. Accordingly, the behavioural performance of 1 participant from  paired associate task and 3 participants from marble maze task were excluded.


## Materials
### Memory tasks

  Declarative memory was assessed by a paired associate (Word-Pair) task. Using an online random noun generator and Microsoft Power Point, random word pairs were generated and displayed to participants.  During the training slide-show, a total of 60 word-pairs were displayed for 5 seconds each, with a 5 seconds inter-stimulus interval (\textsc{isi}) (blank slide with a central fixation point). The researcher asked participants to remember as many word-pairs as they could Following the treatment condition, subjects were again shown a new set of 60 slides, consisting of 20 word-pairs that were presented during the initial training session, 20 word-pairs that were novel combinations of words that had been presented during the initial training session, and 20 word-pairs consisting of words that were not used in the training slide show. During the test session, participants were asked to respond “yes” or “no” to the word-pairs: “yes” for a word-pair that they saw in the training session, and “no” for any word combination that was different from those they seen during the training session. \par


  Non-declarative (procedural) memory was assessed using the *Marble Maze* visuo-motor task, which consists of two knobs on the right and lower side used for controlling the tilt of the surface \autoref{marblemaze} [@brio]. The goal of the task is to pass a small marble along the lined path by turning the knobs \autoref{marblemazeabove}. The score on each trial is determined by the number of the hole that the marble falls into, with higher scores indicating better performance and superior manual dexterity. shows the plate, in which marbles ran through. The training and test session consisted of 100 and 50 trials, respectively. To reduce fatigue and maximize the effort of the participants, the researcher asked them to take a break at the mid-point of the training session (i.e., after 50 trials), as well as introducing an incentive (e.g., gift card) to the participant obtaining the highest score.

### Self-report measures
  The Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory (FMI) is a 14-item assessment designed to evaluate the experience of mindfulness in experienced, novice, and non-meditators. Scores range from 14 to 56, with higher scores indicating a greater degree of mindfulness [@walach2006measuring]. In this study, the FMI was employed to capture the participants’ ability to engage in a “mindful” state (see Appendix E). \par
The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) is an 8-items questionnaire that measures general daytime sleepiness by assessing the subject’s self-reported tendency to fall asleep in various situations of daily life. A higher ESS score is indicative of a great level of sleepiness [@johns1991new]. In this study, a modified version of ESS was employed to measure sleepiness before and after the treatment (see Appendix I). \par

  In addition to these standardized questionnaires, participants were asked to fill out a condition-related self-report. Meditators self-reported if they meditated, as well as the length and the quality of their meditation session on a scale of 1 to 5, with higher numbers indicating greater quality. In a similar format, participants in the napping condition self-reported their sleep quality (1-5 point, with higher numbers indicative of higher nap quality), and people in wake condition reported whether they fell asleep while watching the movie (see Appendix F, G, H).


## Polysomnographic recordings

Polysomnography was conducted employing standard procedures, as follows:

*  EEG: O1-F7, O2-C4, according to the international 10-20 electrode placement system, with bilateral mastoid references.
*  EOG: Right and left outer canthus, with the bridge of the nose as reference.
*  EMG: At the chin for assessing jaw muscle tone.

\autoref{eegcaplabel} shows a schematic illustration of EEG electrode placements. The electrodes used were Genuine Grass Gold Disc Electrodes (Natus Neurology, Ireland). All signals were amplified (Grass P511 amplifiers, half-amplitude filters set at 0.3 Hz and 10 kHz), digitized (200Hz; PowerLab /30 system running LabChart software, v. 8.1.11, AD Instruments, Toronto, Ontario), and stored for subsequent offline analysis (using LabChart software).

### Measures of sleep
  Under blind conditions, EEG recordings obtained in nappers were visually scored using the Rechtschaffen & Kales sleep scoring manual and its recent amendments [@hobson1969manual, @sleep2001proposed, @silber2007visual]. The number and/or duration of the following parameters were computed: number of arousals, sleep onset latency, Stage 1 sleep duration, Stage 2 sleep duration, slow wave sleep (SWS) duration, and total sleep time. SWS was calculated by adding time in sleep stages 3 and 4. Sleep onset latency was determined with reference to the time when lights were turned off and the door was closed [@plihal1999effects]. For participants in the wake and meditation condition, the EEG record was reviewed to confirm that sleep did not occur.

### Measures of meditation
  For meditators, EEG records were subjected to spectral analysis using fast Fourier transform computed for 30s EEG epochs to determine power spectral density in the frequency bands of interest (2-20 Hz). Based on these power spectra, the two dominant frequencies were identified for each 30 seconds, and epochs with dominant frequencies in the alpha-theta range were considered to constitute a "meditative state", based on prior research showing enhancement of alpha-theta activity during meditation [@lomas2015systematic, @lee2018review]. In addition, the averages of recorded frequencies were used to correlate with their degree of mindfulness, as indicated by FMI. <!--Finally, EEG data were subjected to a series of cluster analysis using eegUtils package were performed.  ### this section needs to be completed with the data gathered from R -->

### Measures of declarative memory
  In order to capture the overall performance of participants in the paired associate task, single performance measure was required that encompasses all of the hits (True Positives), false alarms (False Positives), misses (False Negative), and correct rejections (True Negatives). The performance of an individual discriminating between two classes (positive and negative) is described by a confusion matrix (see Table \ref{confusion}). \par


\begin{table} [H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l c c } \hline
& \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{Answered Class}} \\ 
\hline
\textbf{Actual Class} & Positive & Negative \\ 
\hline
Positive & TP & FN \\ 
Negative & FP & TN \\ 
\hline
\end{tabular}
\setstretch{1}
\caption{\textit{Confusion matrix was used to define the performance of participants in paired-associate task. TP = True Positive. FP = False Positives. FN = False Negative. TN = True Negatives}} 
\label{confusion}  
\end{table}

  Since the declarative memory test consisted of 20 old items and 40 novel + recombined items, I had to choose a performance measure that is non-sensitive to the class imbalance problem [@straube2014evaluate]. I decided to use the Geometric Mean (G-Mean) to calculate overall performance (see \autoref{GMean}). TPR stands for True Positive Rate (see \autoref{TPR}) and TNR stands for True Negative Rate (see \autoref{TNR}).

\begin{equation}
\label{GMean}
G-Mean = \sqrt{TPR \times{} TNR}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{TPR}
TPR = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{TNR}
TNR = \frac{TN}{TN + FP}
\end{equation}


### Measures of non-declarative memory
  The median is a robust measure of central tendency and is less affected by outliers and skewed data than the mean, making it a preferred measure when the data distribution is not symmetrical. Therefore, I decided to calculate the median of the last ten trials of the training session (trials 91-100), and compare that to the median of the first ten trials of the test (i.e., memory retention) session (trials 1-10). 

## Data analysis
  Statistical analysis was performed using R (R Development Core Team, 2008) and the psycho [@makowski2018psycho], and the rstanarm [@gabry2016rstanarm] packages. The analysis was performed in the Bayesian framework as it was more reliable, with better accuracy in noisy or small data samples, a more straightforward interpretation
and less prone to type I error [@van2014bayesian, @jarosz2014odds, @makowski2019dispositional, @wagenmakers2018bayesian]. The frequentist
equivalent of statistical analysis, which returns similar results, as well as more details of Bayesian model can be found in the Appendix <!-- name of the page -->. Calculation of the sleep parameters relied on Microsoft Excel for Mac (Version 16.19; Microsoft).

<!-- ### Assumptions
For each ANOVA, I checked the following:

1.  Normality of model residuals (assessed by QQplot and Shapiro-Wilk test)
2.  Homogeneity of Variance (assessed by Brown-Forsyth test and Levene's test)
3.  Linearity (assessed by observed vs fitted values plot) -->

### Declarative memory
  Bayesian inference was performed using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Gaussian model `(4 chains, each with iter = 2000; warmup = 1000; thin = 1; post-warmup = 1000)` to predict G-Mean `(formula = GMean ~ Condition)`. By fitting a general linear model, I compared the effects of experimental conditions (meditation, sleep, quiet wake) on the performance of participants in paired-associate task using G-Mean. For the general linear models, all priors were set as mildly informative (normal distributions with mean=0). I reported several characteristics of the posterior distribution of the effects: the median (a robust estimate comparable to the beta from frequentist linear models), MAD (median absolute deviation, a robust equivalent of standard deviation) and the 90% credible interval. Instead of the p value as an index of effect existence, I also computed the maximum probability of effect (MPE), which is the maximum probability that the effect is different from 0 in the median’s direction. For our analyses, I considered an effect as probable if its MPE is higher than 90%.

  Additionally, I ran several exploratory logistic regressions on the role of gender on the G-Mean values.
To assess the effect of SWS, I divided the napping condition into two groups (SWS and no-SWS) and analyses were carried out separately.

### Non-declarative memory
  Bayesian Inferences.was performed using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Gaussian model `(4 chains, each with iter = 2000; warmup = 1000; thin = 1; post-warmup = 1000)` to predict the Median Scores `(formula = MedinScores ~ Condition + (1 | Code))`. For mixed models, participants were set as the random factor. By fitting linear mixed-effects models, I compared the effects of experimental conditions (meditation, sleep, quiet wake) on the performance of participants in the Marble Maze task using median values. I reported several characteristics of the posterior distribution of the effects: the median (a robust estimate comparable to the beta from frequentist linear models), MAD (median absolute deviation, a robust equivalent of standard deviation) and the 90% credible interval. Instead of the *p* value as an index of effect existence, I also computed the maximum probability of effect (MPE), which is the maximum probability that the effect is different from 0 in the median’s direction. For our analyses, I considered an effect as probable if its MPE is higher than 90%.
  
  Additionally, I ran several exploratory logistic regressions on the role of gender on the differences of median values.
To assess the effect of SWS, I divided the napping condition into two groups (SWS and no-SWS) and analyses were carried out separately.

### Spectral analysis of meditators' brain oscillations
  Bayesian correlation between the alpha and theta power spectra and behavioural performance on memory retention were calculated. Additionally, we ran exploratory correlations between the alpha and theta power spectra and history of meditation practice (in months), as well as their level of mindfulness, indicated by FMI.
  
#### Outliers
  In total, data of four individuals were excluded from the analysis. Three individuals fell asleep through the meditation session, and one participant had numerous arousals (n=11) throughout the napping session.
