## Frequentist report

### Declarative memory

The overall model predicting GMean `(formula = GMean ~ 1 + as.factor(Condition))` explains 7.64% of the variance of the endogen (adj. R^2^ = 4.61). The model's intercept is at 0.80 (SE = 0.025, 95% CI [0.76, 0.85]).

Within this model:
   - The effect of as.factor(Condition)NAP is not significant (beta = -0.026, SE = 0.033, 95% CI [-0.093, 0.040], t = -0.79, p > .1) and can be considered as small (std. beta = -0.23, std. SE = 0.29).
   - The effect of as.factor(Condition)WAKE is significant (beta = -0.080, SE = 0.036, 95% CI [-0.15, -0.0078], t = -2.22, p < .05) and can be considered as medium (std. beta = -0.70, std. SE = 0.31).

### Non-declarative memory

#### non-SWS

The overall model predicting MedianScores `(formula = MedianScores ~ Condition + (1 | Code))` has an total explanatory power (conditional R^2^) of 59.98%, in which the fixed effects explain 4.50% of the variance (marginal R2). The model's intercept is at 5.53 (SE = 0.55, 95% CI [4.46, 6.60]).

Within this model:
   - The effect of ConditionNAP is not significant (beta = -0.63, SE = 0.93, 95% CI [-2.42, 1.17], t(43) = -0.68, p > .1) and can be considered as small (std. beta = -0.24, std. SE = 0.35).
   - The effect of ConditionWAKE is not significant (beta = -1.29, SE = 0.78, 95% CI [-2.81, 0.23], t(43) = -1.65, p > .1) and can be considered as small (std. beta = -0.49, std. SE = 0.30).

#### SWS

The overall model predicting MedianScores `(formula = MedianScores ~ Condition + (1 | Code))` has an total explanatory power (conditional R^2^) of 67.51%, in which the fixed effects explain 6.22% of the variance (marginal R2). The model's intercept is at 5.53 (SE = 0.51, 95% CI [4.54, 6.52]).

Within this model:
   - The effect of ConditionNAP is not significant (beta = -1.24, SE = 0.77, 95% CI [-2.74, 0.25], t(47) = -1.61, p > .1) and can be considered as medium (std. beta = -0.52, std. SE = 0.32).
   - The effect of ConditionWAKE is significant (beta = -1.29, SE = 0.72, 95% CI [-2.69, 0.11], t(47) = -1.79, p = 0.08) and can be considered as medium (std. beta = -0.54, std. SE = 0.30).

## The interaction of gender in non-SWS subset of nappers on non-declarative memory task

I fitted a Markov Chain Monte Carlo gaussian (link = identity) model `(4 chains, each with iter = 2000; warmup = 1000; thin = 1; post-warmup = 1000)` to predict Median Scores `(formula = scale(MedianScores) ~ Condition * Gender + (1 | Code))`. The model's priors were set as follows: ~ normal (location = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0), scale = (0.50, 0.50, 0.50, 0.50, 0.50))

The model has an explanatory power (R^2^) of about 60.06% (MAD = 0.077, 90% CI [0.47, 0.72], adj. R^2^ = 0.24). The intercept is at -0.086 (MAD = 0.20, 90% CI [-0.40, 0.24]). Within this model:

  - The effect of stage 1 and 2 sleep has a probability of 74.98% of being negative (Median = -0.19, MAD = 0.28, 90% CI [-0.65, 0.28], Overlap = 74.61%).
  - The effect of quiet wake has a probability of 70.28% of being negative (Median = -0.13, MAD = 0.25, 90% CI [-0.54, 0.28], Overlap = 78.90%).
  - The effect of being Male has a probability of 99.50% of being positive (Median = 0.73, MAD = 0.28, 90% CI [0.28, 1.19], Overlap = 19.60%).
  - The interaction between nap and being male has a probability of 53.97% of being negative (Median = -0.039, MAD = 0.41, 90% CI [-0.65, 0.67], Overlap = 96.14%).
  - The interaction between quiet wake and being male has a probability of 78% of being negative (Median = -0.33, MAD = 0.43, 90% CI [-1.07, 0.37], Overlap = 71.10%).
